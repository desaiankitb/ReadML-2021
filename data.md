1. [Product-images](https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
	- Amazon and University of California, Berkeley collaborated to release a dataset of product images with metadata to advance research in multiple areas of computer vision, particularly 3-D inference!

	- Dubbed the Amazon Berkeley Object (ABO), the 300GB dataset contains multiple images of 147,702 products, including 360° rotations and 3-D models for thousands of them.

	- Metadata includes multilingual title, brand, model, year, product type, dimensions, and material.

	- 398,212 static catalogue images

	- 8,200 images that provide 360° rotations in the plane at 5° intervals (72 perspectives per product)

	- 7,900 fully 3-D product models that can be rotated along any axis and rendered in any 3-D environment under any lighting conditions

	- Would you work on a project that has the potential to benefit shoppers worldwide?
